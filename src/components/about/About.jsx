          Joshua Towolawi, a young aspiring artist. Who is currently studying
          fine arts in college but wants to progress to be more than just a fine
          artist. Born in north east London, he grew up in Kent, where his
          brothers introduced him to the japanese animation Shaman King by
          Hiroyuki Takei. Later Joshua would discover other japanese animations
          by the form of Shonen jump. This inspired him to pursue a career in
          the arts. Joshua participated in various mediums of artistic forms.
          Still in education as he aspires to take his art to the next level and
          produce concept artistry in a freelance format. His style is massively
          contributed by Salvador Dali, because of their immense creativity and
          world building. Sui Ishida (artist for Tokyo Ghoul, Tokyo Ghoul:re and
          Choujin X ) is also one of their inspirations due to their unique ink
          design of characters and their colouring methods. When discussing what
          Joshua needed they specified a place where they can display their work
          and be able to communicate with people about their pieces and work.
          There needed to be an about page so they could describe to future
          employers and clients what kind of work they do. They specified that
          they wanted the website colour way to be modern enough but in a darker
          format. When discussing the content within the website they required a
          bold structure so clients can distinguish what part of the website
          they are on. And reiterated that a shop was non-negotiable with a
          section for commissions. Lastly they requested for a newsletter for
          anyone who deceived they were interested in their latest pieces and
          early drops/ commissions.
